# bl-model

`bl-model` is a collection of all the class definitions used in boklisten.no.
Everything from `Item` to `Branch` is defined here.

This module is made so definitions are equal across all applications and
modules. If you intend to define a new class that should be used by more than
one module it should be defined here.

No actuall code functionality is written in this module, only definitions.
Think of it as a collection of interfaces.

# Some of the classes defined
