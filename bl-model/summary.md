# bl-model

`bl-model` is a collection of all the class definitions used in boklisten.no.
Everything from `Item` to `Branch` is defined here.

This module is made so definitions are equal across all applications and
modules. If you intend to define a new class that should be used by more than
one module it should be defined here.

# Some of the classes defined

- Item
- Branch
- CustomerItem
- UniqueItem
- BranchItem

# Development

To read how to develop for this module [please read bl-model's github page](https://github.com/holskil/bl-model/blob/master/README.md)
