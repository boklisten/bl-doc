# Bl-doc

Documentation for boklisten services.

This book should give you the basic knowledge of all boklisten services.

We have three main services and applications: `bl-api`, `bl-web` and `bl-admin`.

### Bl-api
A backend service that controls the data and is used as a broker between `bl-web` and `bl-admin`.

### Bl-web
The frontend application the customers uses. Here the customer can either rent, buy or loan items.
They can also use it to view information provided to each branch and to extend a deadline.

### Bl-admin
The frontend application for employees. Here the employee can view status of a item, rent,
sell and buy items and take out repports.
