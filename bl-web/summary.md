# bl-web

bl-web is the customer application for boklisten. Written in typescript and
using the angular 2+ framework.

## Introduction

When a customer at boklisten wants to order a book or view information about
our opening hours she visits our [website](https://boklisten.no). On this
website the customer can order books, view user details, contact information
and create a booking.

Our website is `bl-web`. Everything on the website is maintained inside `bl-web`.

This application is created for the customer in mind only. Employees should use
`bl-admin`.

## Concept

The concept for the application is simple. A customer should be able to order
books and then receive them either by mail or by visiting one of our pop-up
stands. After the customer has received the item she can visit the website and
look at her order or view her current items.

## Functionality

- can view opening hours for each branch
- booking for a specific hour at branch
- view and select which items to buy/rent/loan
- checkout with payment capabilyties
- edit user details
- view all orders
- view all items rented
- navigate through info pages

## Goal

The goal for `bl-web` is to be as simple to use as possible and to provide all
functionality needed for renting books. Ultimate goal is an application that
the customer almost don't need to use.
